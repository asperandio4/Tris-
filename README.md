# Tris!

_Tris!_ is a Single-Page Application that allows its users to challenge each other online to the Tic-tac-toe game.

## Deployment

To use the application in a test environment, you must first download its sources. Also, it is necessary to download and
configure Node.js, which is distributed with its package manager (npm).

Done that, you can start the application:

- **client side:**
    - move to the _client_ folder
    - launch the `npm install` command to install all dependencies
    - run the `npm run build` command to generate the build folder containing all the optimized application sources

- **server side:**
    - move to the _server_ folder
    - launch the `npm install` command to install all dependencies
    - run the `node index.js` command to start the server

The application is now accessible from the browser at the [http://localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001) address.
